    "\n",
    "> Vessel traffic data, or Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, are collected by the U.S. Coast Guard through an onboard navigation safety device that transmits and monitors the location and characteristics of vessels in U.S. and international waters in real time. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center have worked together to repurpose some of the most important records and make these records available to the public. These records are sourced from the U.S. Coast Guard’s national network of AIS receivers called the Nationwide Automatic Identification System. Information such as location, time, vessel type, speed, length, beam, and draft have been extracted from the raw data and prepared for analyses in desktop geographic information system (GIS) software. Note that Marine Cadastre does not have access to live AIS data feeds or more recent data than what is provided on this webpage.\n",
