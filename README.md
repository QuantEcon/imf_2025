# Modern Computational Economics and Policy Applications

![](qe-logo-large.png)

## Abstract

Open source scientific computing environments built around the Python
programming language have expanded rapidly in recent years. They now form the
dominant paradigm in artificial intelligence and many fields within the natural
sciences.  Economists can greatly enhance their modeling and data processing
capabilities by exploiting Python's scientific ecosystem.  This course will
cover the foundations of Python programming and Python scientific libraries, as
well as discussing their use for economic policy applications. In addition, the
course will discuss new developments in the Python scientific ecosystem
being driven by artificial intelligence.

## Instructors

[Chase Coleman](https://github.com/cc7768) 
Chase Coleman received his PhD in Economics from New York University in May
2019. He is a co-founder and Managing Director of Valorum Data. He was an early
contributor at QuantEcon and has given lectures and workshops on Python,
Julia, and other open source computational tools at institutions and
  universities all around the world.

[John Stachurski](https://johnstachurski.net/) is a mathematical and
computational economist current based at Kyoto University who works on
algorithms at the intersection of dynamic programming, Markov dynamics,
economics, and finance.  His work is published in journals such as the Journal
of Finance, the Journal of Economic Theory, Econometrica, and
Operations Research.  In 2016 he co-founded QuantEcon with Thomas J. Sargent.

## Software

The main interface to Python will be either `jupyter-notebook` or `jupyter-lab`.

Access to the `ipython` REPL will also be useful.

Some work will be done remotely using Google Colab --- a Google account is
required.

Required Python libraries (much of which is found in the Anaconda Python distribution):

* `numpy`
* `scipy`
* `matplotlib`
* `pandas`
* `scikit-learn`
* `statsmodels`
* `numba`
* `f2py`
* `quantecon`
