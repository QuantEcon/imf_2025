# Quadratic Map Time Series Exercise

This project reproduces the figures from the Live Coding Exercise on the quadratic/logistic map.

## Mathematical Model

The quadratic map (also called logistic map) is defined as:

```
x_{t+1} = g(x_t)  where  g(x) = 4x(1-x)
```

This generates trajectories starting from an initial condition x_0.

## Project Structure

- `quadratic_map.c` - C code that generates data for the quadratic map
- `plot_figures.py` - Python script using matplotlib to create the figures
- `*.csv` - Data files generated by the C code
- `figure*.pdf/png` - Generated figures

## Usage

### Step 1: Compile and run the C code

```bash
gcc -o quadratic_map quadratic_map.c -lm
./quadratic_map
```

This generates three CSV files:
- `quadratic_function.csv` - Function values for plotting g(x)
- `trajectory.csv` - Time series data with x_0 = 0.3 for 150 iterations
- `histogram_data.csv` - Long trajectory with 100,000 iterations

### Step 2: Generate the figures with Python

```bash
python3 plot_figures.py
```

This creates:
- **Figure 1**: The quadratic map g(x) = 4x(1-x) and 45-degree line
- **Figure 2**: Time series showing chaotic behavior when x_0 = 0.3
- **Figure 3**: Histogram of 100,000 iterations showing the U-shaped distribution

## Figures Generated

1. `figure1_quadratic_map.pdf/png` - Shows the quadratic function and 45-degree line
2. `figure2_time_series.pdf/png` - Shows the erratic, chaotic time series
3. `figure3_histogram.pdf/png` - Shows the symmetric U-shaped distribution

## Key Observations

- The quadratic map exhibits **chaotic behavior** - highly erratic trajectories
- Despite chaos, there are **statistical patterns** visible in the histogram
- The histogram is symmetric and U-shaped, showing more observations near 0 and 1
