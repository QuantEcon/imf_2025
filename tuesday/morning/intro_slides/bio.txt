# About GRIPS

The National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies (GRIPS) is a relatively young
graduate university established in 1997. Our primary focus is on educating
mid-career government officials (although, recently, we have an increasing
number of students from the private sector). We are a single-faculty institution
dedicated to policy studies, with a diverse team of faculty members specializing
in various disciplines, including economics, political science, international
relations, public administration, and civil engineering. Our research and
educational activities encompass a wide range of public policy areas, from
economic policy to science and technology policy, foreign policy, security
policy, and disaster management and infrastructure policy.

Our faculty comprises around 75 full-time members, with approximately 20% being
international and more than half holding degrees from overseas institutions. We
currently have about 400 students, with 70% enrolled in mostly one-year master's
programs. Notably, 60% of our students are international, from over 50
countries, and as I already mentioned, most are mid-career government officials.
